Hello, I'm **Sam**.

Just an ordinary guy who enjoys trying to build something on the interwebs, just to see if I can.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably working, parenting, playing sports, or doing something outdoors. I like to always be busy.

**Bonxy?** Just look here.

This is my personal blog â€” a space for thoughts, notes, and an archive I can scroll through when wandering down memory lane.

If you wish to contact me: _sam \[at\] bonxy \[dot\] net_
