Last night me and [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com) went down to the [02 Academy](http://www.o2academyleeds.co.uk/), Leeds to go and see Cher Lloyd live in concert.

When pulling up and stepping out the taxi I was shocked at the size of the queue there was already, and we where 30 minutes early!! There was loads of kids with there parents but I didn't imagine that there would be this many.

So after a longish queue in the freezing wind we reached the academy from doors. They where doing bag searches for food and drink and anything else naughty that you where not allowed to take in. As soon as becks knew this she said to me that they will take her SLR camera off her. They did just that. We had to go to one side and protested for a while before they said that we could go and put it in the cloak room downstairs.

Although this was not the best solution, it was the only option that we had to hand.
