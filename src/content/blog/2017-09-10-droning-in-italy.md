In August, [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com) and I were in the car, starting our road trip across Europe towards Italy for a family wedding.

It didn't take me much persuading to pack the drone in the car's boot. I managed to get a few flights in and around our villa ([Villa Baroncino](https://www.villabaroncino.com/)) located near Perugia, which is about 100 miles north of Rome.

I did have a bit of trouble with the drone while I was over in Italy. Every time i tried to take off in certain areas of the Villa and surroundings i would get a compass error. I tried flying without the GPS, but it makes flying difficult and non-enjoyable.

The only remedy i could find was to take a 10 minute walk down the driveway of the Villa and take off near the gates and then fly back.
