So Saturday started with a 20.7-mile (33.3 km) hike around 2024 Cleveland Survival, where the average temperature was 23℃.

We started at 8:44 on Saturday, and altogether the hike took 5h 47m 16s to complete.

We managed an average pace of 1.658km/h with a max of 2.36km/h whilst also climbing 605.2 meters of elevation and an average heart rate of 136.4.

> Really enjoyable hike this year. Got wet shoes just after mile one when we had to go through an unavoidable bog but they did dry eventually. Weather was on our side and made it a lovely day. Definitely wasnt as hard as previous survivals but enjoyable never the less.
