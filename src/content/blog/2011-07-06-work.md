Hello. 

Just sat at work and decided that I would write a quick blog. Shifts have been changed at work AGAIN. Now we are working 12hour shifts 6AM – 6PM. It’s a bloody killer, especially when you do an extra bit of overtime on top of your original overtime. Yeh, that’s right, I did start at 6AM and finish at 9PM. . Id rather be doing the 7.30AM – 7.30PM shifts but meh, gotta do what you gotta do. 

Whilst working these ridiculous hours at work I have been doing all the cross passage DB schedules. Pretty interesting and it makes the day go by which is good. 

Anyways, going to crack back on now. Only 2 more days to go until the weekend. WOOOOP

Cyah
