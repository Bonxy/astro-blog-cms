Oh my days. If you have not been. Why not ??? If you have. You will understand my excitement.

Friday the 19th of august and i was awake at 06.30AM to go to my mates house for 07.00AM.

Today we where off to Amsterdam. 

I was going with another 2 lads who have been 7 times before so they knew what to do and where to go. We all met at Teesside Airport (Durham Tees Valley) and checked in and where having our first pint by 7.45AM. Bleh, tasted horrible. Oh well. Plenty more to go.

We got on the plane at 9 ish and it was only an hours flight to amsterdam. As soon as we got there we where looking for pubs to get the first beers from. We went to a Coffee Shop where they sell numourous amounts of weed. Ive never seen anything like it and its so bloody cheap. Everyone around Amsterdam seems to be stoned but i guess it whats there all used to. Throughout friday we got wrecked by drinking the local beer. 

Im not a huge beer fan, but thats all there really was. Heineken or Amstel, which are the local beers where what we drank most of the time. We used to just have one pint in a pub then move onto the next one making our way around amsterdam. We did go in one bar, called Bulldog. They had a challenge in there where if you had 10 pints you got a free t shirt. Well, its not like us to turn down a challenge and we knew we had plenty of time to do it so thought lets go.

They give you a card which you get stamped everytime you buy a pint (Bit like the nando's cards). It certainly didnt take us long to get 4 t shirts. I most say that i think we looked the part! Ha.

When we left Bulldog, I think we where all pretty worse for where. We potted around a few of the other bars stopping for more drink and some of the others had the odd reefa. 

When it got later into the night you start realising why they call it the red light district. Originally, I thought it was a place/area within Amsterdam but I was wrong. The red light district is everywhere in Amsterdam. Shops have red lights out the front, and where there is a red light there is a nice looking lady. 

Everyone will already know what these ladies are but some of them are gorgeous. Makes you think what are they doing behind a glass door down a dingy alley. But meh.

There is 100's of red lights round Amsterdam itself and I guess you just choose who you fancy and walk on in. 

Anyways, after we had done some window shopping (Just to mention no purchases where made) we headed back to the hotel place where we would be staying. The hotel itself wasn't to bad. We had one room which was huge. 4 singles beds inside it for us and an en suite bathroom with shower which was spot on. We had a nice big window out the front which looked out onto like the front of a cafe where loads of folk sat until late on which was good. The only real downfall for me, and the rest of the boys was the constant smell of shit that was in the room. Lmao. 
We don't understand why the room smelt like this alls we know is it did and it wasn't nice!!
