This is my first xbox live game that i have ever finished. Ive always liked the DiRT games and DiRT 3 was by far the best in my eyes.

I bought all the extra DLC packages so got the full **1250 G**. 

Im now going to attempt to complete [DiRT 2](http://www.trueachievements.com/game.aspx?gameid=2036&gamerid=332095) as there isnt many more achievements i need to complete it and then that will leave me with DiRT 1 which i have everything to complete. lmao.

Im going to go back to racing now. Bye!
