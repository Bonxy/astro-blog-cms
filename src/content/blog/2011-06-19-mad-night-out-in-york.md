Well, i blogged last week about the 'Paired Drinking' that was organised in york for friday night. 

Alls i can say is what a mad night it was. Absolutly immense. Loved every second of it being dressed as chuckie finster. 

Some of the other people that where out with us also had some really good costumes. There was buzz lightyear, batman & robin, jessie and little bo peep from toy story. Lots of colourful power rangers and the odd superwomen. 

We ended up getting wasted as planned and moved on to a club after that. Ended up getting in at rediculous oclock. What more could you ask for ?
