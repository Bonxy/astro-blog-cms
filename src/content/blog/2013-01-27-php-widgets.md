As some of you may know I'm currently in the process of create my very first Wordpress plugin ([Xbox Achievements](http://bonxy.info/2013/01/xbox-achievements-plugin/)). 

The idea behind the plugin is you will enter your gamertag in the settings and the rest is done by the app. It will download your game library and achievements for display on your blog.

Everyone wants to know what the last achievements you earned are? What games you have been playing recently?

So, I decided to include a widget!
