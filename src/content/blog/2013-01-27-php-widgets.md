As some of you may know, I'm currently in the process of creating my very first WordPress plugin ([Xbox Achievements](http://bonxy.info/2013/01/xbox-achievements-plugin/)).

The idea behind the plugin is that you will enter your gamertag in the settings, and the rest is done by the app. It will download your game library and achievements for displaying on your blog.

### Achievement Widget

One of the main features I'd like to include is a recent achievement list. Everyone wants to know what the last achievements you earned are. What games have you been playing recently?

So, I decided to include a widget!
