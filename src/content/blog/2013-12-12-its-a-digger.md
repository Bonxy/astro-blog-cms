So this is my third Lego Technic build and is model 42006. (_You can see all my lego builds here:_ [_Tag: Lego_](https://bonxy.info/tags/lego))

So i bought this a few months ago. I really enjoyed this build and i think this model is a bit more functional than your everyday tow truck.

I personally didnt think the tracks would work too well on this model but i was wrong. They took a while and where a bit fiddly to put together but they make the model totally unique.

There is 2 switches for gear selection at the back of the model.

*   One controls the top boom forward and backwards motion, flick it the other way and it controls the bottom boom.
    
*   The second controls the opening and closing of the claw which has a really strong grip which i proved by lifting cans up off the side of the sofa! :D
