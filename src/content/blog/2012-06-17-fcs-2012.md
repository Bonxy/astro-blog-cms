So this was my 4th year on the trot to French Car Show but the first time it was hosted Donington Park.

As with every FCS, its about the drive down, and the night out. That's the best bits for me.

The show is quite repetitive nowadays (_There is only so much you can do at a car show..._).

We met at Scotch Corner Services at 11AM and then made our way from there collecting some more members from Wooley Services on the M1.
