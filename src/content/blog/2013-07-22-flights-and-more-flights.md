description: So here I am 3 hours into my flight to Bangkok Thailand
---

So here I am 3 hours into my flight to Bangkok, Thailand. 

Current time is 21:20 (GMT) which is 23:20 at origin and 3:20 in Thailand. 

My day started early getting a taxi from a mates it Bradford to Manchester airport. 

Leaving Manchester at 11am to Istanbul. 

That was the short flight over. 3 hours and 20 to be precise. Then 2 hour wait in Istanbul airport and we jumped in to the next plane. 

So now I'm sat in an Airbus 330. Probably the biggest plane I've ever been in. It has decent reclining chairs with personal TV screen with games controller and everything. 

So now I have another 5 hours and 47 minutes to go and to pass the time I'm watching Transformers 2. 

Ill update more on arrival.

Night.
