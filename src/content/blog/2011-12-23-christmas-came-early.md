Well, not for me, for [@Cadab](http://www.imjam.es).

Last week, when I was out shopping, I decided to pick up some RC Helicopters as they're really fun when you're geeks like us and boy was I right. After a quick 30-minute charge, our faces were smiling, and the fun was being had.

Here is a quick video @Cadab filmed of me on my phone.
