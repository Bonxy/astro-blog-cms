Well not for me, for [@Cadab](http://www.imjam.es).

Last week when i was out shopping i decided to pick up some RC Helicopters as there really fun when your geeks like us and boy was i right. After a quick 30 minute charge our faces where smiling and the fun was being had.

Here is a quick video @Cadab filmed of me on my phone.
