So, this is a quick jot down of my time and symptoms with Corona. 

Isolating started 8/2/21 because of close contact.

Symptoms, mainly constant headaches, noticed on 11/2/21.

Tested on 13/2/21 and alerted positive at 22:30.

14/2/21 Felt fine all day to be honest. Nothing other than the headaches bothering me. 

15/2/21 Headaches intensified with a lot of aches and pains, more coughing, runny nose and sore throat. 

16/2/21 Not aching as much and the headaches seem to have faded a bit but I’ve not lost my sense of smell and taste. Around 5pm onwards I started feeling sick and really tired. 

17/2/21 Although feeling a bit tired earlier, I didn’t fall asleep until 5:30. Was wide awake and just couldn’t settle. Still feel sick, not been able to eat much. Headaches are still here as well as blocked nose and sore throat. Still coughing. Shoulders and knock are really aching today too. 

18/2/21 Feeling better than yesterday but still got headaches, coughing, blocked nose and sore throat etc. Didn’t have any appetite and still feeling a bit sick. Not aching as much. 

19/2/21 Woke with a headache, feel better again that yesterday but very short of breath. It feels like you can’t take a deep breath, like something’s stopping you. Taste and smell is still no better. Don’t feel as sick.
