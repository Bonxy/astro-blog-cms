I think this is the best game I've ever played!

The size of the map, the quality of the story, the artwork involved and all the silly side missions that keep you coming back for hours!!

I haven't even mentioned the different cut scenes you see when changing between characters or just cruising to top of mount chilliad on a quad bike.

It's amazing!!

I'm not going to post any spoilers in this post so you are safe to read on.

I've been playing this game for 12 days now and have accrued 53 hours to the minute of writing this post. (You can follow my progress here - [https://bonxystuff.com/myxbox/1414793383](https://bonxystuff.com/myxbox/1414793383)) and have a completion percentage of **86.47%** so yeh, I've been playing it quite a bit.

Personally I thought the story was brilliant. I liked the intreduction of heists and the fact you can plan them to your own taste makes it a lot better.
