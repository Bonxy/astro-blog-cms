Chernobyl for me was always fascinating. From the accident, to the cover up, to the containment. It’s been something that I’d always wanted to see. 

Finally, having found a cheap weekend trip to Kiev things where coming together. I was going to be able to see Chernobyl. 

The tour from start to finish with Chernobylwel.come was brilliant. Organised, informative. Everything I expected and more.

Our tour guide Andre was brilliant. His English was really good and he managed to answer any question the group threw at him. There was only 9 of us on in our party which meant you got to engage with each other and the guide so much easier.

We stopped plenty of times to view everything from the power station itself, to the sarcophagus the damaged reactor 4 now sits in, to rambling through Mother Nature that has engulfed the village of Pripyat.
