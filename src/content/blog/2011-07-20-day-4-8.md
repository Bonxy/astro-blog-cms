Well, i have not had much access to my blog as of late and have not recently updated.

I have still been cracking on with my keep fit excercise over the weekend. Ive received my new 'Ab Circle Pro'. 

So i went on that 15 minutes on the morning and 15 minutes on the evening and did that over the weekend aswell as my other excercise. Its actually quite good and you dont really feel that you are on it for as long as you are.

Anyways, im going to try and keep this up-to-date from today but we shall see how that goes. Ha

Sam!
