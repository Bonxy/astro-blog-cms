Well, a few friends off Cliosport.net had been talking about a little meet over Teesside Park as part of 'The Big One' which was a meet by NEMM (North East Modded Motors) for there 10th anniversary. 

In fairness, i under estimated the size of the meet. There was easily in excess of 1000 cars. Some lovely looking motors there and i snapped away at a few.
