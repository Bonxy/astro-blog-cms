Well, sunday is here and ive had a wicked lie in. Was absolutly knackered and needed the catch up.

So whats been going down. I came back from work on thursday and straight away was busy remapping another mates car. Once i had done that we went out for a little drive and he was another happy customer. On friday, i didnt have much to do. I knew i had to go and get some paintballs from the shop and i wanted to get my hair cut as it was a bit out of control. (It does happen)

So i went into town at about 12.30 with a 1.30pm appointment and had a quick look around the shops. Nothing really took my fancy, but i definatly need some more jeans. Im sure i lose them!!

I got my hair cut and then made my way to Battle Zone in stockton to go and get some paintballing gear.

Whilst in there voicing my opinion about the shitty ecofill ballls that jammy got the week before i decided i wanted a shorter barrel for my gun. I opted for the Big Shot which i previously bought @Cadab for christmas. He rated the barrel very well, and with it being practically half the size of my original 14inch barrel i went for it. We also went for some Pro paintballs, which apparently is what the BZ team play with. Friday night had came and i had been speaking to @Cadab and we decided to go and see the new transformer film. As i posted recently when i seen it on the wednesday night, it was bloody fantastic. I loved watching it again. Cant wait for it to come out on DVD. Im sure rosie huntington got fitter to! ;)

So saturday came and with not much sleep (Transformers didnt finish until gone midnight) @Cadab came round to pick me up. We loaded the car, hit tesco for some sandwiches, then mcdonalds for a breakfast then made our way to paintballing. 

Due credit to BZ as the paint was spot on. Splatted every time which is obviously what you want in paintballing. Also, playing with the smaller barrel is so much different. Obviously reducing the overall length of your gun by 6 inches it makes it so much easier to move around in the bushes and long grass and i can keep it safely tooked under my arm when running around to avoid it getting caught on anything. There was some other people there on the day with there own markers who we had a bit of a play with which did get a bit heated at one point down to a certain cheater but we wont talk to much about that. 

As always, we had the GoPro there. I ran with it this week but in the middle of me running down the trench on the attacking of Alamo it came undone. I spent about 2 minutes trying to bodge it in place, but when you have no materials and there is paint flying everywhere its not the easiest thing to do. 

Anyways, back on track. I took the route with the trench and ran right around the back with the black netting. This always seem to be my plan now as it is so effective. I took out quite a few of there team and we ended up winning.  :D

Come to deffending the Alamo, we lost, not by many though, and there was a bit of confusment with one of the marshalls ending the game short when we still had people left in the Alamo. Weird but meh.

Saturday night came, and after a long shower and spending the next 3 hours watching the the last 3 episodes and the reunion of Jersey Shore, ive finally finished season 3. Kinda sad as i got so into it. Watched all 3 seasons within 8 days and loved them all. Cant wait for season 4 to come now.

Saturday night, and i wanted to go into Yarm to go and watch the Haye fight. Unfortunatly not everyone was on the same wave length as me, and Fenby was going to Vegas at 4AM the sunday morning, so i went round his with a few bottles and sat there with his family and watched the match. 

IMO, Haye didnt have nothing all game and he did well to get 3 of the 12. He needed to defend the jab more and make more contact than he did. 

So now its sunday morning, and i dont know what the plans are for today. I think i have football later but thats about it. Wouldnt mind doing a bit of #Geocaching as its a lovely day but we shall see.

Ciao.
