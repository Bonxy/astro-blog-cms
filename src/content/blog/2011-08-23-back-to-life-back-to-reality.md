Well, as I write this I'm on my 30 minute lunch break at work on the lovely Conoco Phillips refinery in hull where the weather can only be described as crap. 

I'm wet through, tired and I'm still hungry so all is not good. 

Can't believe that I was in Amsterdam at the weekend. I wana go back!!

Oh well.  Role on 4 o'clock which is when I finish, then hopefully a nice early night tonight. I've also been invited to Sophie's Birthday party tomorrow. It has an army theme to it so I've dug out the combats and the face paint so it should be a good laugh. 

Chizzy Reverse have another game on thursday night which hopefully we can carry on our winning streak which we started last week. 

This up coming weekend I'm off to Sheffield on saturday for another piss up with the boys and girls which should be a good laugh. 

So that's my plans for the upcoming week/end. Just thought I'd share them with you.
