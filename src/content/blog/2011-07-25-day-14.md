What a mentle day. I'm soo bloody tired. 

After having a massive weekend ( which ill blog about tomorrow when I'm on the computer ) in york and in leeds I ended up having about 3 hours sleep all weekend. 

So as you can imagine I was flipping knackered. Ruined in fact. 

Well today I've been back on the training. I had a good weekend really, didn't eat hardly anything not because I wasn't hungry, because I was so ill. (Yes, all drink related).

Today, I've started as I mean to go on. 

**Breakfast at 10AM**
- 2 x Poached Eggs on brown toast
- Orange Juice

**Lunch**
- Jacket potato and beans. 
- Orange Juice

**Dinner**
- Chicken Pasta
- Yoghurt

So as you can see. A pretty healthy day. We are going swimming tomorrow and I have footy on wednesday so a pretty active week. :)
