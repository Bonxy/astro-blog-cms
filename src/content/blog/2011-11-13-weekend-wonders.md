Hello blogees.

The is the first blog im writing on my new laptop. Sadly, on friday, my beloved dell laptop, which served me so well in the last 3 years died. It wouldnt charge and wouldnt turn on. Ive took it into the computer store to see if they could possibly fix it as id love to have it back as a back up laptop but ive not yet heard from them. Ill have to contact them this week to see whats happening.

The weekend itself was mainly centered around my step mams birthday. The plan was to all go to leeds as thats where my two step sisters live and then we can go out as a whole family for somthing to eat and a few drinks.

I invited my girlfriend and my two steps sisters invite there boyfriends and then there was my aunty and other sister. 

We started at my aunty's flat at about 6 for pre drinks and decided that instead of going out for food we would just order in pizzas. A variety was ordered in and we stuffed our faces whilst downing more alcohol.
