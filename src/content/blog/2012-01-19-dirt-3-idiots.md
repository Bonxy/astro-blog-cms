Ok, this is probably my favourite game for the xbox but it is acctually full of ~idiots~.

Rallying always has been, and always will be a non-contact sport. I know this a game and sometimes people cant help it but OMG. Some of these are dumb.

You get an extra ranking as a driver which can go to a highest of 'Honourable Driver' which means your a good driver and play fair (No crashing into people or objects). But when other people start crashing into you on purpose because your over taking them and then you role or hit a tree you lose your ranking which is flipping stupid.

It really annoys me which is why im venting my anger on here where probably nobody will see it rather than over xbox live!
