Well today i finally went and did my catapult experience that [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com) had bought for me for my birthday back in October 2011.

The catapult is only done at very few ![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7267/7809584604_ac53f424fe_m.jpg)locations around the UK. The closest one to us was Chester so we thought we would go do the jump, then make a day of it around Manchester.

When we got to the catapult it was a bit smaller than i expected. Just a crane, probably 100 Ft high or so and a basket with the elastic attached under it.

You stood on the base and had one rope attached to your harness, the elastic then was pulled tight so you where hovering in mid air, then a member of the crew would pull the release pin and off you went. 

Ill let the pictures do the talking..
