Well, today I finally went and did my catapult experience that [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com) had bought for me for my birthday back in October 2011.

The catapult is only done at very few ![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7267/7809584604_ac53f424fe_m.jpg)locations around the UK. The closest one to us was Chester, so we thought we would go do the jump, then make a day of it around Manchester.

When we got to the catapult, it was a bit smaller than I expected. Just a crane, probably 100 Ft high or so and a basket with the elastic attached under it.

You stood on the base and had one rope attached to your harness; the elastic was then pulled tight, so you were hovering in mid-air. Then, a member of the crew would pull the release pin, and off you went.

I'll let the pictures do the talking..
