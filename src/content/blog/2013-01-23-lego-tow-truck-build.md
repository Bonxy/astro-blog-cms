I was as excited as a fat kid in a sweet shop when I got my Lego Technic Tow Truck.

As a kid I had loads of Lego. I used to build anything. I think I was about 9/10 when I got my first ever Lego technic set. I got a green dump truck. I was only young so don't think I could build it that well. Now I look back to it was over 1500 pieces!

So, after reading a thread on a forum I go on where a lad got a Tower Bridge Lego set. This went on to loads of people going out and buying some amazing Lego models. I shopped around for a good few hours before I came to the decision that I wanted the _Crane Truck (8258)_.
