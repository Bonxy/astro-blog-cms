Well what a weekend. 

It was my uncles stag do on saturday so I was up at the crack of dawn ready for it. I headed off to pick a friend up at 8.30 PM and then to make my way down to Isaac Wilsons (Weatherspoons) which was near Middlesbrough train station.

Dressed up looking like the nuttiest golfer around we walked into the pub to be met by the rest of the lads who where all dressed alike. Having my first pint at 9AM and a bacon bun, I knew it was going to be a heavy day.

Nipping into Dundas Arcade shortly before heading to the train station to pick up some cans for the journey was an experience in itself.  Never got so many looks or sniggers in my life but hey, at least we all as stupid. 

We got on the train just in time and went to our reserved seats. 2 tables either side of each other with enough seats for us all.
