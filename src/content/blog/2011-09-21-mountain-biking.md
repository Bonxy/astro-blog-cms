Well on saturday i decided to go downhill mountain biking. I havn't been in ages so thought id dig out my old kit and get back into it. 

I invited my mate @Cadab who came along with me. We went to a place called Hamsterly Forest which is suituated in durham. When we set off there the weather was not looking to good. It was a fine drizzle. We still carried on going and it turned out to be a really good day.

Here are a few videos from the day.
