So at the weekend me and my girlfriend [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com) decided to drive to [#Newcastle](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23Newcastle) to go and see the Olympic Lights.

The Olympic Lights are a set of 7 lights of different colours which when lit together look like a rainbow. Ok, so there more lasers than lights. These things can apparently be seen from up to 20 mile away, but [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com) said she definitely seen them up to about 40 miles away. **_debatable_**

Well, we arrived in Newcastle at about 9PM and it was pitch black. There was alot of traffic at that time of night around St Marys Lighthouse, Whitley Bay which is where the lasers where based.

I thought the lasers did a display or did somthing wild but i was wrong. Alls they did was just shine in a straight line. Dont get me wrong they did shine some distance and did look good, but with a **£50,000** price tag, it seemed a bit of a waste in my eyes but hey. What do i know ? :P

Anyways, i did take a few pictures on my phone but [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com) did take some brilliant photos which can be found on her FlickR account here: [http://flic.kr/s/aHsjz3cU52](http://flic.kr/s/aHsjz3cU52)

Here are some of the pictures i took.
