Went to the Ice bar in London today for a quick drink. Ha. 

What a place. Freezing in there as you can imagine but brilliant at the same time. 

You got given the cloaks that you can see [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com) modelling below.

The drinks on offer in there are tiny like but taste nice. 

I'd recommend anyone to go. 

Ill write more on it when I write a weekend summery.
