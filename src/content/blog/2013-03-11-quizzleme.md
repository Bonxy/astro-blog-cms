QuizzleMe is an all new type of APP available on iOS and Android.

The idea behind the APP is you have a question and 5 possible answers. You hit the answer as fast as you can. Your time is calculated at the end of the round (5 questions per round) and then sent to your opponent. They will then take there turn on the same questions and the winner is decided at the end of the round. 

Coins are used in the game. They are awarded for winning a round, even awarded for losing around. You can then use your coins to purchase premium categories of question which you might have more knowledge about than the standard categories. 

You can easily search for your friends in the game and also invite contacts straight from your phone book.
