## Hello EV.

Soo ive joined the electric car club. Well, i joined it in October last year but yeh, I traded in the Mini and bought myself a **Vauxhall Mokka E**.

### Was it the right decision?

Ultimately, for me, yes! The cost of running the Mini was around £240 a month on fuel. The Mini was a real thirsty car average maybe 31-33 mpg (About 19-21 pence per mile) which isn't the best. The Mokka on the other hand is getting roughly 170 miles from a full charge which is currently costing me on my split tariff rate ~£3.30. As a comparison, this is working out at just under 2p a mile which is a saving of ~17-19 pence per mile.

So yeh, the car does save me quite a bit of money. I'm charging it roughly twice a week (~£6.60) plus the odd weekend charge averages out to about £25-£30 a month.

### Long Distances?

Well, this was always a concern. I had not done anything over 150 mile round trip in the 11 months of owning the car up until last week. I was going to be driving to Worcester from Teesside. The journey was going to be roughly 220 miles so i knew id need to plan a charge in somewhere. I found a Tesco not far off my route which had some fast charges and planned to stop there. Upon arriving, there was a bank of chargers with plenty spare. I charged the car up to 80% in about 20 minutes whilst we went in Tesco buy some snacks and use the facilities. On the way back we stopped at the same spot to charge which worked perfectly again.

### Overall

In the 11 months of ownership ive really enjoyed having the electric car. Having a full charge on a morning whenever i want it is a huge perk, not having to plan to go to the garage. The preconditioning feature of the car is brilliant. Goodbye to scraping windscreens on a morning when its -2. Its been pretty easy going with the Mokka E.
