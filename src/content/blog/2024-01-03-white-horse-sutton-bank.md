Today started with a 10.1-mile (16.2 km) hike around White Horse / Sutton Bank, where the average temperature was 11℃.

We started at 10:13am on Saturday, and altogether the hike took 3h 4m 10s to complete.

We managed an average pace of 1.487km/h with a max of 9.44km/h whilst also climbing 446.8 meters of elevation and an average heart rate of 111.7.

> Freezing. Thats one word that can be used to describe this walk. It was cold, wet and just generally minging. Still managed 10 mile but it took me the rest of the day to warm up.
