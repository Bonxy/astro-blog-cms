OMG

**Best concert ever!!**

[@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com) bought me some tickets as a surprise for the Kanye West / Jay Z Watch the Throne concert at Manchester Arena.

We drove up and left the baked bean in a ridiculously over priced car park. We then went into Manchester in search for food. (Becks gets hungry!). We got pizza from Pizza Hut and then made our way back to the arena.

We where sat on tier 2 of to the right of the stage. They where really great seats in fairness. The whole place felt like it was 100 degrees.

That didn't stop it from being a great concert. They played n\*\*\*\*s in paris 6 times and every time was better than the last. They also played loads of there own music as well instead of just the Watch the Throne songs.

Kanye West's All Of The Lights was, in my opinion, one of the best songs of the night. :D

We couldn't take the SLR inside, and the little point and shoot camera just kept taking black pictures as it was that rubbish.

The few videos and pictures that I did get which where good enough to post are below. I have a few videos as well which I will link to when I post them on Youtube.

Thanks.
