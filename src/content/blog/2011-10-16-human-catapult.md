For my birthday on this month i got an unusual present.

It was a reverse bungee jump. Instead of jumping from a platform, you stand on the floor and then the bungee is tentioned and then someone releases you and you are fired 100FT up into the air. 

Its the same thing that David Hasselhoff had to do on the game show Red or Black.

Heres what it looks like. *Skip to **3** minutes.*

Cheers.
