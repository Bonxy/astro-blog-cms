So for years now, in my spare time, I have a strong passion for web development. I have no qualifications in this sector, so I’m basically self-taught.

My favourite things to do a lot of the time are to try and build pages/sites to show stats for the services I use. Some of these services have really taken off with a large user base, some just stay personal for me.

I wanted to try and write some posts on some of the pages/sites I have made for me to keep track of but also to maybe give some insight on how I’ve achieved it just in case someone else around the globe is wanted to do design something similar.
