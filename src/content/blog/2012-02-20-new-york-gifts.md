Unfortunately it was not me who went to New York, it was [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com) ( :( ), but i guess the good thing with having a girlfriend is you get spoilt. 

So on her arrival home, i get some very lovely gifts off her! :D

Here is a picture below.

I love my new angrybird, as i do with all my [angrybirds](http://bonxy.info/category/gin-pop/angrybirds/)! Also, M&M world. We visited here in London back in december and it was amazing. I could never have imagined the place even if anyone tried to explain to me, but becks said it wasnt as good in NY (I think she may have just been saying this to dull it down for me :( ).

I also got a pair of Abercrombie & Fitch (We got a situation!! ;) ) boxer shorts, which i wont post a pick of as im sure we all know what boxer shorts look like.

Anyways, ill post a link to becks new york blog post and photos when she posts it online.
