I booked these tickets back in November or even October and then just forgot about them. They where sat on my bedside table until the other week when I was looking for something and picked the envelope up and remembered them. 

The concert was about 9 days from this point so it was quite a nice surprise.

So when the 21st of March came around, I had my car pre-packed and got away from work an hour early at 3PM. I started my journey to Doncaster to go and get ready at [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com)'s house.
