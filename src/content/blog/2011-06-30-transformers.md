OMG. Seen this film and its flipping amazing.

Loved every single minute of it. Being a huge transformers fan and a huge megan fox fan i was a bit worried that this one wasnt going to cut it since she was missing but Rosie Huntington-Whitely filled her role and better if its possible.

The story was brilliant as they always are, and watching it in 3D, my first time seeing a transformers film in 3D was obviously even better. 

I actually cant wait to go and see it again and see the bits that i missed. Shia Le Beuf played his part awsomely to. I really like him as an actor. Ive got a few films that he is in like iRobot, Disturbia, Indiana Jones 4.

I definatly recommend you all to go and see this film. You will NOT regret it.
