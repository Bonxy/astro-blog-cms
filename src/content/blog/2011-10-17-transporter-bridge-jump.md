Ive been wanting to bungee jumping for a while and with it been on my bucket list there isnt a better time to do it than off an iconic teesside landmark.

I found a site that does the jumping (UK Bungee) and they have a bungee day on the 6/11/2011. 

So hopefully, me and my mate, @Cadab ;) are going to go and throw ourselves off the top. 

:D
