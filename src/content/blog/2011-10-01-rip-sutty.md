description: Yesterday morning I got a text message off my mam to say my Rabbit had died
---

Yesterday morning I got a text message off my mam to say my Rabbit had died. 

The poor thing was only 18 months old and it didnt really show any signs of dying.

It was fun, and boney, but it has always been like that and the fact it still ate when i fed it bits and bobs and used to bomb it around the garden like a missile.

But thursday night why i was away from home it became week, and she spent 4 hours cuddling the little thing until it went unconcious in the early hours of friday morning then passed away shortly after.

I was devestated when i found out the bad news as would anybody be. The guinea pig (George) will now be alone this winter. I just hope he doesnt take the loss of his mate that badly and fights through.

Here are some pictures of sutty..
