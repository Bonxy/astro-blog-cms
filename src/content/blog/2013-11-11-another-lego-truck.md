Well, after buying my first Lego Technics model back in January ([Lego Tow Truck Build](https://bonxy.info/posts/lego-tow-truck-build)), I decided it was time to invest in a bigger one.

My birthday wasn't far off, so I decided to go for the Lego HGV Tow Truck (42008).

This one, unlike the other, was fully motorised with a hydraulic T-bar and boom, including a winch. It also had rear stabiliser legs for picking up heavy loads.

This one was far more complex than the first one, and the main gearbox to control everything was a lot more complicated and fiddly. Once the engine and the gearbox were built, it went quite easily from there.

In total, I think it was a 1500-piece set and took about 5 / 6 hours to complete.
