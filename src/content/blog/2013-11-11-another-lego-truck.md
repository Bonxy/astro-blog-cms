Well after buying my first Lego Technics model back in January ([http://bonxy.info/?p=16269](http://bonxy.info/?p=16269)) I decided it was time to invest in a bigger one. 

My birthday wasn't far out so I decided to go for the Lego HGV Tow Truck (42008).

This one was far more complex that the first one and the main gearbox to control everything was a lot more complicated and fiddly. Once the engine and the gearbox was built it went quite easy from there.

In total I think it was a 1500 piece set and took around about 5 / 6 hours to complete.
