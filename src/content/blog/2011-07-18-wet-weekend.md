Well, the title says it all and in all fairness i think the whole country has got wet some time this weekend.

The weather has been awful hasnt it? It started on thursday the 14th for me. Left work at 12PM to start my 4 hour journey home. I drove 10 mile down the road from work and it started to rain. Now, driving in the rain doesnt bother me one bit. For some strange reason i find it quite relaxing. But what does get on my nerves is every other dick on the road that thinks because it has started to rain means you can drive along at 50MPH on the outside lane of the M25. *Move the f*%k over!!*

Well, after a slight delay and a few more plebs on the road i finally reached the A19. Love it when i reach this point as it means im exactly 28 mile from my house. Brilliant (Y).

We were just about to go past the turn off for Thirsk and 2 cop cars shot on the road and straight into the outside. One was a silver Audi A4 or A5 estate, the other a blue BMW M5. These both just had 2 little blue lights in the back window. Very smart cars. Off they shot up the road. 

5 minutes later we where driving towards home (Northbound) and in the distance on the opposite side of the road (Southbound) was loads of flashing lights. On closer inspection when we got closer i seen a dark blue BMW 520D with its hazards on and flashing its main beam vigarously. It was weaving all over the dual carrageway and undertaken using the hard shoulder. Behind it there was 19 police cars we counted in total. (I think i now know every under cover police car in the north of england. :D)

After this had gone past we seen even more police cars flying down the southbound side of the A19 dual carrageway. In total i counted 23 police cars. 

As i got to my turn off for Ingleby Barwick i noticed on the opposite side of the road on the entance slip road onto the A19 from ingleby was a 520D police car with a smashed up front end. Unfortunatly i wasnt fast enough to get a picture of the car. In my opinion it looked like it had either tried to stop the escaping blue BMW or the escaping blue BMW didnt like the cop car being to close. Who knows ??

When i shortly arrived home after seeing the police chase i deicded to have a quick search on Google news and see if anything had been posted.

I did find this: hhttp://bonx.us/?qt6

Basically, a hit and run on a securicor van in county durham tesco and the men where trying to flee the scene. Madness!!!

Anyways, i got home at about 5PM and i had a football match at 6.45PM with some friends. Unknown to me we where starting up a new team in the league. It was our first game which we dominated the opposition funily enough called 'The Misfits'.

I didnt do anything after that on the thursday night. Just chilled out and had an early night. 

I woke up at about 10AM on the friday, nice little lye in after my ridiculous start times at work. :( The Plan was to go into town and get my hair cut but i could particulary be arsed to do this. Instead i went for a nice jog and then came back and did some training on my new *Ab Circle Pro*.

I then went and picked my mam up and took her to tesco and did some shopping with her. I had spoke to @Cadab before this and decided that i would make us some tea and that he would come round on his way home from work. 

I got some chicken and pasta and a nice sauce and made some chicken pasta. Was lush! :D

We spent the rest of the night playing on the xbox on #Dirt3. I LOVE this game at the moment. Im actually going to try and complete the full game so this will be the first game i have ever fully completed on my xbox.

Saturday morning came and after a bit of a slow start and realising we where going to be late for paintballing i decided to finally get out of bed. The weather was a disgrace. Driving to paintballing it rained and rained and rained. We finally got to paintballing and met up with another two of our mates Fraiser and Fish. We started to get our gear on when @Cadab realised that his boots wernt in the back of my car. (This was my fault as he asked me to get the stuff out of his car boot and place it in mine while he went into his house. - In my defence, i didnt notice them in the boot. >:])

So, off he went in the baked bean and drove back to his house. When we go to paintballing we dont normally play the opening game as its a bit stupid and its for the other people to really just get used to the guns. I stood and chatted with the other two boys whilst waiting for @Cadab to come back. 30 minutes-ish later he arrived just in time for Alamo. 

We went out for this game and ended up defending first. We had been split up from the other two just to make the teams a bit fairer. Me + Jammy V Fraiser + Fish - BRING IT ON!!

Well, we seemed to get his pretty badly in the defence, but meh, your ment to lose it. Thats what its designed for. 

It was now our turn to attack. As with every other week i decided to do my normal role. Running down the outside trench and making my way inside to pretty much destroy the whole team. **p0w p0w**. 

We only stayed for 3 games as the weather was very poor. I ended up going home and staying in again (Not like me i know :( )

Ended up playing #Dirt3 again until about 2AM in the morning and then i went to sleep. 

Sunday came and not alot was going down sunday either. Does really help when the weather was as bad as it was. It was thunder and lightening all over the NE, with the power dropping out all over certain areas. Luckily for me our area was ok, just very wet. 

@Cadab came round and we decided to go out for a drive in the rain. It was quite an expeirience. (Y)

We then decided to go to Tesco and get some dinner. We decided to get wedges, chicken, beans and garlic bread. Bit of a mix up but it was gorgeous and really did hit the spot. After then chilling out on a cornetto ice cream we decided to go and play a bit more #Dirt3 .

When it came to about 6PM ish i decided i would set off to my dads to go and visit him and fix his laptop. I took the very wet A19 and A1 to retford where he lives because he is working down there. We ended up watching topgear then going for a few pints. A chicken kebab later and watching 'Departed' on film4 or whatever i set off on the rest of my 151 mile journey to london. 

Now here i am. At work, tierd, updating my bloggy. Have fun and thanks for the read. 

Sam!
