..and yes we did.

After we had finished off getting the server all set up and online we decided to go to tesco and see if we could get project lium into space.

We bought some balloons from tesco but then found out that they didnt do helium. So we made the decision to venture into teesside park even though we knew it would be busy. 

Turned out it wasnt busy at all, but when we went into the card shops we seen the helium canisters that they where selling and they where up for Â£35. 

This was way out of budget for a cheapy cheap space mission. We knew that we could get helium canisters off the internet so decided we would order one this week and hopefully carry out the experiment the next time we get the chance.  :D
