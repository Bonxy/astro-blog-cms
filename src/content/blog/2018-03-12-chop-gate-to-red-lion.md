So, it's only 3 weeks to go until the [Cleveland Survival 2018](https://clevelandmrt.org.uk/cleveland-survival/).

We took part in the event for the first time last year and completed it in a rather impressive _(for us)_ [**8h 30m**](https://www.strava.com/activities/2078928416).

So to stretch our legs ready for the event, we decided to get out and put some miles under foot. We decided to try and hike from [Chop Gate to the Red Lion Pub,](https://goo.gl/maps/Jvm5FmmDhCs) but we didn't quite anticipate just how bad the weather would be on top of the moors.

The weather was quite bad with snow up there, worse than we thought. We decided after 5km that we would turn back. [**Hugo**](https://www.instagram.com/hugothecockapoo) was freezing up there, and it wasn't the nicest. We thought we would head over to Captain Cook instead to carry on moving.

### [Captain Cook Loop](https://www.strava.com/activities/1445508464)

We managed to complete another 9km+ from Captain Cook's car park all the way round, until we made it back to the car park. Slightly warmer but still wet. Think we managed to tire Hugo out finally.
