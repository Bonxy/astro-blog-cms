So, it's only 3 weeks to go until the [Cleveland Survival 2018](https://clevelandmrt.org.uk/cleveland-survival/).

We took part in the event for the first time last year and completed it in a rather impressive _(for us)_ [**8h 30m**](https://www.strava.com/activities/2078928416).

So to stretch our legs ready for the event we decided to get out and put some miles under foot. We decided to try and hike from [Chop Gate to the Red Lion Pub](https://goo.gl/maps/Jvm5FmmDhCs).
