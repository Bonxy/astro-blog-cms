Well its been another hard day buy i feel immense now for some reason. 

Last night i went to bed. Was tired from the training i had done.

Woke up this morning, and my abs where hurting. Still, i just got on with it. I have not ate much today. Heres what i had..

**Breakfast at 10AM**
- Poached egg on brown toast
- Apple

**Lunch at 1PM**
- Jacket Potato with Beans
- Apple & Orange

**Dinner at 7PM**
- 2 Chicken breast

I feel ive done pretty well. Still feel hungry, but after my training, i just feel more tired. So thats why im now off to bed.

G'night. :)
