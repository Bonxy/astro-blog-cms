A while ago i created a little notepad script so me and my mate could edit bits of code we created when we where in different locations by just clicking the save button.

It was a really easy script to build with it just writing everything in the text box to a .txt file.

Here is some of the logic.

Like i say, really easy just using the fwrite function. 

If anyone wants to have a play they can.
