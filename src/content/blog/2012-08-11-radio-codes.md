Im a regular member of a Clio enthusiasts site called [Cliosport.net](http://www.cliosport.net) and there is always threads online about how people have forgot or cant find there radio unlock code.

Renault and a lot more car manufacturers now add this little bit of security to a standard radio unit to detour car thieves.

The code has to be entered every time the radio is disconnected from the power source. ![Serial Number](http://projects.bonxy.net/radio/images/pre-code.jpg)

If you go to renault for your unlock code, they will charge you around **Â£20**.

So, i found a program online that could decode your radio security number and display you your unlock code. I let [@Cadab](http://imjam.es) take a look at the program and he managed to knock together a script which would go through and display all the unlock codes that the program could offer. (***26,500** in total.*)

So then it was down to me to make a simple PHP website that would offer an easy to use system with paypal integration to offer users there radio code instantly!

The site was built and online within about 2 hours. You can see the site here: [http://projects.bonxy.net/radio/](http://projects.bonxy.net/radio/?referer=blog).

The site does not need any maintenance at all and will hopefully tick over in the background for the near future.

I am looking for new ways to integrate more car manufacturers to the unlock code site to bring in more users!
