Sunday the 14th of August. 7.45AM and im sat in the car park for the Blue Bell, Yarm.

I was sat waiting for the other boys and girls to turn up so we could start our long journey down to Alton Towers, Derby.

We arrived there at about 11.30 and jumped straight on the monorail and headed for the park. 

There was 10 of us in total who went. 5 girls and 5 boys. It worked really well with the numbers as there was an even amount for all the rides and then the bigger ones we could have all the boys and all the girls. 

The first ride we all went for was Air. I had been on this before so knew what to expect but for some of the lads it was there first time on a rollercoaster. The que only took about 20 minutes, but that was a good 20 minutes of winding him up about how dangerous these things are just so he was petrified before he went on! :DWe got to the front of the que and hopped on taking our shoes off. The bars came down and your feet get locked in, then it flips you forward. Ahh, love it! 

Its all over in a matter of 20 seconds but they are brilliant. After air we decided to go on Nemesis. Nemesis is a bit of an Alton Towers class. I think its one of the first rollercoasters that was built there and is still one of the favourite ones. Again, we didn't que for to long, maybe 15 minutes and then we where on the ride. 

Some of the other rides we went on where; 
Rita - Queen of Speed
Th13teen - Which was brilliant. Loved it!! 
Oblivion

We also went on some of the little ones to like the water rapids and the log flume. 

The weather held out well aswell for the full day and fun was had by all. I definatly want to go back soon-ish and experience the other rides that we missed out on.
