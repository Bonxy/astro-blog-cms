## ðŸ—¼ Travelling to Paris from Disney Land or the surrounding areas isn't as daunting as it looks.

I've recently stayed atÂ [Centre Parcs Villages Nature Paris](https://www.centerparcs.eu/in-en/france/fp_VN_holiday-park-villages-nature-paris)Â for a week and visited Disneyland, where we did all things Disney in the area. However, we also wanted to go into Paris to see attractions like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Notre Dame, etc. So I decided to jot down some notes on how we got there and what lines we used, ticket information, etc, as we couldn't find much information online.

We decided to get the train into Paris from **Marne-la-VallÃ©e/Chessy**, which is situated 60 seconds from the main gates to Disney. The line we used was the **RER A** (RER = RÃ©gion Express Railway). You can see on the map below that we went from **Marne-la-VallÃ©e/Chessy** (top right) to zone 1 **Gare De Lyon**.

We chose Gare De Lyon due to its connections to different lines and metros, but ultimately we were interested in the **RER C** line, which would be able to take us around Paris to the tourist spots we needed to get to. The walk to Paris Austerlitz from Gare De Lyon ([click for Google Maps link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qdfs9kWf9V7edB3c6)) was about 6 minutes over a footbridge across the Seine.

Once inside Gare De l'Austerlitz, a quick escalator ride downstairs and you're on the platform. I don't think we ever waited more than 10 minutes on a platform for a train in Paris; they are non-stop. The trains once on board tell you which stops are coming up, so it's really easy to keep track of where you are on the line.

Once you reach your decided station, hop off and scan your pass through the gate, and you're away. We used the RER C to make our way to the Eiffel Tower (Champ De Mars) and then back from there to the Louvre (MusÃ©e d'Orsay) and our last stop at Notre Dame (Saint-Michel Notre Dame).

## **ðŸŽ« Tickets / Navigo Easy Pass**

Like a lot of major capitals, you can travel around Paris using an EasyPass. You can either get a physical pass from one of the 1000s of ticket machines at the station or top up your E-pass on your phone. Depending on the number of stops you need to make, a day pass might be more suitable for you.

*   Single journeys (station to station) Â£2.50 - kids are normally half price.
    
*   Day pass (excluding stations) Â£12 - again, kids are normally half price.

## ðŸ“’ Notes & After Thoughts

I decided to write this blog based on my own experience and the difficulty of finding some easy information on how to get around Paris. I hope that in future it helps someone else. Don't be put off by the thought of travelling around the French capital. There are so many great sites to see, and it doesn't have to be scary. The above worked for me, travelling with a 6-year-old. There were a few times when strangers _squeezed_ through the barrier behind us (fare evading), but we didn't say anything; we just carried on as normal and let people do their own thing.
