Travelling into Paris from Disney Land or surrounding areas isn't as daunting as it looks.

Ive recently just stayed at [Center Parcs Villages Nature Paris](https://www.centerparcs.eu/in-en/france/fp_VN_holiday-park-villages-nature-paris) for a week and went to Disneyland and did all things Disney in the area but we also wanted to go into Paris to go and see things like the Eifel Tower, Lourve, Notre Dam etc. So i decided to jot down some notes on how we got there and what lines we used, ticket information etc as we couldn't find much information online.

We decided to get the train into Paris from **Marne-la-Vallée/Chessy**, this is situated 60 seconds from the main gates to Disney. The line we used was the **RER A** (RER = Region Express Railway). You can see on the map below, we went from **Marne-la-Vallée/Chessy** (top right) to zone 1 **Gare De Lyon**.

We choose Gare De Lyon due to it having connections to different lines and metros, but ultimately we were interested in the **RER C** line which would be able to take us around Paris to the tourist spots we needed to get too. The walk to Paris Austerlitz from Gare De Lyon ([click for google maps link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qdfs9kWf9V7edB3c6)) was about 6 minutes over a footbridge across the Seine.

Once inside Gare De Austerlitz, a quick escalator ride downstairs and your on the platform. I dont think we ever waited more than 10 minutes on a platform for a train in Paris, they are non stop. The trains once on board tell you which stops are coming up so its really easy to keep track of where you are on the line.

Once you reach your decided station, hop off and scan your pass through the gate and your away. We used the RER C to make our way to the Eifel Tower (Champ De Mars) and then back from there too The Lourve (Musee d'Orsay) and our last stop at Notre Dam (Staint -Michel Notre Dam).

Tickets / Navigo Easy Pass

Like a lot of major capitals, you can travel round Paris using an easy pass. You can either get a physical pass from one of the 1000s of ticket machines at station or top up your E-pass on your phone. Depending on the amount of stops you need to make, a day pass might be more suitable for you.

*   Single journeys (station to station) £2.50 - kids are normally half price.
    
*   Day pass (excluding stations) £12 - again, kids are normally half price.

Notes & After Thoughts

I decided to write this blog based on my own experience and difficuilty of finding some easy information on how to get around Paris. I hope in future it helps someone else. Dont be put off at the thought of travelling around the French capital. There are so many great sites to see and it doesnt have to be scary. The above worked for me, travelling with a 6 year old. There were a few times when strangers _squeezed_ through the barrier behind us (fare evading) but we didn't say anything, we just carried on as normal and let people do their own thing.
