I had a few people ask me about it so i took some pictures just to show you.

I bought all my gear from: [http://www.merlinmotorsport.co.uk](http://www.merlinmotorsport.co.uk) in case you wanted to know.

This is how i started. I wanted to put 20mm spacer on so i get the correct studs which could account for this, remember that you need enough to go through the spacer and the wheel and have enough thread for the nut to tighten onto.

Before putting the studs into the hubs, i put the nuts on the end as this makes it easier to put them in.

The nuts and studs can get cross threaded like any other so you need to take your time and be careful when installing them.

The spacer that will sit on the studs.

The cap/ring which makes the wheel sit perfectly on the spacer and stops it from wobbling or anything else.

Right, after putting the nuts on the studs, i got some locktite to secure the nuts into the hub, as i didnt want them coming out everytime i tried to take a wheel nut off. Once i put some locktite on i screwed it into the hub as tight as i could.

Then i repeated the process for the others!

After i had screwed them into the hub tightly, i left them there for about 20 mins. Depending on the locktite you use you might have to leave it there longer. Read the back and it should tell you how long it will take to go solid.

Once i had left them for the recommended time, i used my power bar to take the nuts off the studs, which then left them like this ready for the buts to go on!

There is a ring that you buy to go in the back of the spacer so they sot perfectly on your old hubs and aligns them correctly.

This goes on before the spacer.

Then it was ready for the wheel to go on, and to start putting the nuts on. It is easier if you put all the nuts on first so the wheel doesnt move about when trying to tighten.

As you can see in this picture also is the other end cap/ring that goes onto the spacer to align the real correctly.

Then i put my center cap on and you cant even tell
