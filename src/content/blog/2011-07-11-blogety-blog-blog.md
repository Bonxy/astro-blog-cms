ELO.

I thought id update my blog as im feeling a bit tired and hot at work so take 5 and chill. 

Well, as ALWAYS i had another decent weekend - *I always do like :P*.

Started by leaving work on friday dinner time at 12pm. Started the 4 hour commute home that i had in the ridiculous english weather. It was like a bloody monsoon out there, and when it rains, it means everyone on the UK's roads drives like a tard. IMO, if your not confident at driving in the rain, dont drink in the flipping rain!! DO NOT drive in the outside lane of a motorway or dual carrage way at 40MPH. You are the people that cause most of the accidents. Just GTFO!!!

Anyways, after getting home, a bit more stressed than usual i had a quick shower and that then went to my mothers. I awaited the call from @Cadab to tell me he was ready for the few pints we where going to go to Yarm for because it was his birthday. The plan was to go all out and do the 10 pint challenge. We started in the Black Bull knocking back a pint of Carling first. What a rubbish opening drink imo, could be somit to do with the fact i dont like carling. Oh well. Next came up the bow which obviously for me, went down a treat. Then i think after that we came accross 1664 which isnt to bad. Shortly after the 1664 came the daddy, **Guiness**.

I think this shook the boat a bit for both of us but we did finish them, then headed inside. 

After that we where a bit tipsy, so the odd vodka shot was sure to get us on the rampage. We then ended up going to *The Keys*. We where knocking back bottles and shots like there was no tomorrow. Ended up dancing our pants off which was good fun, @Cadab started knocking out the trademark knee drops ;). 

Really good night in all. Ended up staying over at Cadab's and having a proper breakfast when we awoke the next morning. 

After that, i left and off i went to my mams house to pick up the package that arrived. During the week i went ahead and bought a remote control helicopter. After wanting one for about a year i finally took the plunge as there was a sale on. So i picked it up, went home, got a shower, then made my way back to @Cadab's. We unpacked the helicopter and put the battery on charge whilst looking at the other bits n bobs in the box whilst feeling kind of excited. :D

We then took it into the back garden and attempted to fly it. It was solid, and the fact that @Cadab had been messing around with the switches on the controller he had messed all the settings up. We had to ring Mr.Pembo so he could come to the rescue and sort the heli out. 

We met him at stewarts pack where he brought down his helicopter. He showed off for a bit flying his which is pretty epic. Does exactly what he tells it to do, unlike mine, which crashed more times that a destruction derby car. :(

After about an hour of attempted flying, and then breaking the heli we called it a day. Also, the thunder was heading our way and there was spells of rain. Tbh, the whole weekend was flipping miserable!

Saturday night came and i didnt go out. I just stayed in with a friend and ended up having a few drinks and watching a film. Turned out to be a good night.

Sunday came and i woke up feeling knackered. (I didnt go to bed until 3ish sunday morning). I went downstairs and decided i would go and wash the baked bean as she was looking pretty sorry for herself. I washed it amongst the odd shower that kept coming down and soaking me. 

Sunday afternoon however was better. Ended up watching the grand prix after i had washed the bean, whilst waiting for @Cadab to come round. We then decided to go and grab some scran and head for a spot of Geocaching. We did well, getting about 6 different caches and doing quite a bit of walking. Was good in all fairness and the weather held out a bit. After that we decided to go back to mine and just chill out playing Dirt3. What a game this is by the way. Ive blogged about it before so im not going to go on about it. 

It came to 7 oclock when i wanted to set off and go and see my dad in lincoln. So off i drove down to his. Got there for about 9 oclock. Went out for a pint and got some tea with him. Ended up sitting in front of the tele on the sofa watching 'Lying with the enemy' or thats what i thought it was called. It had Julia Roberts in whatever it was called. Fit byw. ;)

I then left his house to carry on and do that last 180 mile to work which i arrived at about 3AM. After 3 hours sleep and a 6 oclock start, hear i am, 11.38m, feeling tired, drained and i just want to curl up and go sleeps! 

O well, finish at 6. Not long now. Meh!!
