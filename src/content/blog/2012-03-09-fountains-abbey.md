In a bit of a last minute decision me and [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com) decided to meet at Ripon and go for a walk around [Fountains Abbey](http://www.fountainsabbey.org.uk/html/visiting/what-to-see/the-abbey).

Unsurprisingly we both met near Boroughbridge because we are both stupid. I went the wrong way down and ended up on the A1 heading towards Boroughbridge even though I had my sat nav on and she turned off there because "its the way dad goes" and she also had her sat nav on. Oh well.

From Boroughbridge I followed Rebekah as she said she had been a few times before (She quite likes the finer things in life like gardens and theaters. :/). We finally arrived in Ripon and I was sure I had never been to the place in my life even though I only live about 25-30 mile from there. We drove straight through Ripon and out the other side following the brown tourist attraction signs for Fountains Abbey.
