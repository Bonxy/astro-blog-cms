This time next week me and @Cadab will have completed our Bungee Jump off the **Transporter Bridge** in Middlesbrough.

As posted here *[http://bonxy.info/transporter-bridge-jump](http://bonxy.info/transporter-bridge-jump)* about 2 weeks ago we decided to do a Bungee jump and where better to do it than in an our home town of Middlesbrough.

Ill make a video montage (Or @Cadab will) and we will upload it on to here for you all to see, how scared we actually are.

:D
