So I woke on sunday after not the best nights sleep in the world in leeds. The night before, me and [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com) had been to see **Cher Lloyd** in concert who was pretty spectacular might I add. *( You can read about her concert here: [http://bonxy.info/?p=15830](http://bonxy.info/?p=15830).)*

We had organised to meet up with my sister and my aunty who lives in leeds and she suggested that we go to Roundhay Park as it was such a lovely day. Personally, I didn't know what to expect at all. Was it going to be a daft butterfly world in the middle of a park full of little brats or something better?? It turned out to be the latter which was to my amazement.
