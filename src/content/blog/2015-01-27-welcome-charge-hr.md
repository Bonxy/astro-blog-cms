Sticking with Fitbit as i like there style of products and there website / app i upgraded to the Charge HR. The HR standing for Heart Rate!

Yes, ive been waiting for this little gadget to be released for about 6 months now. The Charge HR's smaller brother, The Charge was released back in November '14 and it was crammed with some new cool features.

Crammed with features such as;

*   test
    

```
- All day active tracking including steps, calories, floors climbed and active minutes

- A smart OLED display which display modes, date and time and stats

- On screen caller ID which connects VIA bluetooth to your smartphone

- A excellent 7 - 10 days battery life

- Auto sleep detection with silent alarms
```

The Charge HR does have a shorter predicted battery life as it supplies continuous heart rate tracking 24 hrs a day.
