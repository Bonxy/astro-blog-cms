The second highest peak in the UK. The highest peak in Wales and England.

Snowdon stands at a proud 3,560 ft (1,085 meters) above sea level. On average 360,000 people summit Snowdon every year!

On the 17th of October we wanted to add 2 more people onto the total.

[![Snowdon Route Map](https://blog.bonxy.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Snowdon_Route_Map-218x300.jpg)](http://link.bonxy.net/?url=visitsnowdonia.info/snowdon_walks_-_6_routes-95.aspx)There are numerous ways to attack the summit depending on your conditions and what suits you most. [Visit Snowdon](http://link.bonxy.net/?url=visitsnowdonia.info/) is full of information regarding the mountain and providing information regarding routes and weather updates.

Our route started at Pen-Y Pass and up **Pyg Track**. This is the express route as we started the climb at 12:30pm and we didn't want to get stranded when the sun went down. The climb started fairly easy which was a surprise for us both with some slight inclines, then a nice flat plain with a few more inclines. It was only the latter part of the climb where it started to become difficult with us doing more *climbing* and the odd bit of scrambling.
