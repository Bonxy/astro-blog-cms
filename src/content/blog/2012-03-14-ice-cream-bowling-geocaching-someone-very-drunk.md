It started late on saturday night. After going to the beach on saturday with [@Cadab](http://imjam.es) and Mikey, I went home and stayed in as I knew I was taxi driver that night. My fare? [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com). She was out with some of her old uni friends in York for an event called 'Old Jons'. The idea is that everyone who has been to the uni over the years all meet up in York, go to the SU and get wasted, then go to more pubs and get wasted.

During the even before she got uncontrollably drunk I got a text which read 'I can't wait to see you at 3! Xx' to which I was quite shocked at. 3AM?? I've never seen her drink past 1AM, but apparently she used to do it _all the time_. So that was my evening until I got a text off a mate inviting me to Yarm for a cheeky pint or two.
