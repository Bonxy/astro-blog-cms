## The Idea

So, the idea is to build a motorised trike. This will be the first time I've ever built anything motorised. My inspiration and the guide I'm following is from [Colin Furze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMn8NqbCkDA) Youtube video.

This is what I hope it will look like.

#### Notes

- *There may be a few more items to add to the list which I will add once I've started the build.*
- *Make sure your axle has a full keyway or at least half and half. This will help out when your trying to align the sprocket on the axle and makes life easier in general.*
