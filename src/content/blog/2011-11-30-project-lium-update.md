We did already have planned to do codeword lium a few months ago but due to being on a budget and not been able to find helium cheaper we have put it on hold. 

The weather this time of year is only going to get worse as well so we think its for the best. 

We will sure be doing it next year as it is something I definitely want to do!!  Posted with Wordpress for [Blackberry](http://bonx.us?d4x).
