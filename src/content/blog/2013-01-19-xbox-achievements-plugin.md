As some of you may know, i built a site [http://xbonx.com](http://xbonx.com) which tracks gamertags. It creates game logs for every game you play and accounts achievements you earn. 

Anyways, onto what i want to talk about. 

I always wanted to integrate some xbox live stuff into my blog. A friend of mine [@Cadab](http://imjam.es) had already created a nice little xbox widget for his blog. 

![](http://cl.ly/image/0n1v1u0y0f2h/Image%202013-01-19%20at%208.09.29%20PM.png)As you can see, he has a nice little widget which sits on his blogs sidebar and grabs the last 5 achievements which then link to a nice page which displays all his games from a database.

So, i wanted to create one for myself. I had all the data i needed already. [xBonx](http://xbonx.com) was tracking all my gamerscore and achievements already so i could just select from the correct databases and supply my gamertag and boom, id have all the date.
