As some of you may know, i built a site [http://xbonx.com](http://xbonx.com) which tracks gamertags. It creates game logs for every game you play and accounts for the achievements you earn.

Anyways, onto what i want to talk about.

I always wanted to integrate some Xbox Live stuff into my blog. A friend of mine [@Cadab](http://imjam.es) had already created a nice little Xbox widget for his blog.

![](http://cl.ly/image/0n1v1u0y0f2h/Image%202013-01-19%20at%208.09.29%20PM.png)As you can see, he has a nice little widget that sits on his blog's sidebar and displays the last 5 achievements, which then link to a page that shows all his games from a database.

So, I wanted to create one for myself. I had all the data I needed already. [xBonx](http://xbonx.com) was tracking all my gamerscore and achievements already, so I could just select from the correct databases and supply my gamertag and boom, I'd have all the data.
