description: Well its day 9 today

Well, its day 9 today. 

I started work at 7.30 today, bit later than normally.

Anyways, today, i had my breakfast at 10. 

- Orange Juice
- 2 Poached Eggs on brown toast.

Then for dinner, ive had

- Tin of tomato soup
- Some jacobs crackers

Over the day ive also *snacked* on an apple and an orange. 

I wont be doing any excercise tonight as ive got a footy match after work and will no doubt be knackered after work. I think its hopefully going to be another 7.30 start in the morning and that means i get another nice lay in. Wahoo!

Anyways, Ciao.
