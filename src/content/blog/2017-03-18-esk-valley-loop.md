So an early start on Saturday saw us heading further afield into the North Yorkshire moors. 

The destination was Castleton Station over in Eskdale, North Yorkshire. The Esk Valley Loop is a famous walk around some beautiful places in the North Yorkshire moors. A ~16 mile loop, some of it along the old [Esk Valley Railway](http://www.eskvalleyrailway.co.uk/). 

Although 16 mile is a lot of distance to cover, the walk is quite easy with the major incline towards the beginning and the rest just gradually swooping back down towards Castleton Moor Station. ﻿

Roughly 6 mile into the walk you come across [The Lion Inn](http://www.lionblakey.co.uk/). Situated just off the road is a beautifully set good ol' English pub.

A quick pit stop in the form of a *pint* and we were back on our way. This time walking down the old railway track. This is where you can make up some ground from the pub pit stop as the paths are good.

Following the maps and the GPS you do go a bit off road where the path is barely visable and your making your own way trying to avoid the boggy bits and across the fjord. 

There is plenty of moments around the Esk Valley Loop where you can just stop and take in the amazing views on offer of the moors.

With the finish line in site you do have to walk on the road a bit (roughly 100 meters) but that's all. 

Hopefully this walk will improve our fitness a bit ready for next weekends Cleveland Mountain Rescue Survival. *Fingers Crossed!! ?*
