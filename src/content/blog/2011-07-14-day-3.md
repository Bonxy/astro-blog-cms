Well its 6AM in the morning and I'm just about to start work. 

I'm aching quite a bit from doing exercise last night. Mainly in the Stomach/Abs as I do a lot of crunches. 

Arms are also hurting a bit from doing a few more reps as normal but I know its for the best. 

For today I have a pot of tomato and basil pasta and then for the drive home later I have a ham role. 

Hopefully, that , plus my eggs for breakfast will take me nicely until tea time tonight. 

Ill let you know how it goes! Posted with WordPress for [BlackBerry](http://bonx.us?d4x).
