Today was the day that I jumped from the Transport Bridge in Middlesbrough, and it was **fantastic.**

The feeling of just free-falling towards the water at whatever speed was magnificent. Then, when the bungee kicks in and you are bounced back into the air, is quality. You bounce quite high when you come back up after the initial jump, almost as if you think you're going to hit the bridge again.

You then plunge back down, and the bungee kicks in for a second time; that's pretty much it. It only lasts about 10 seconds in total, and then you feel yourself getting lowered back down to the awaiting boat below.

I can't really say much more as it was that amazing, I can't put it into words. Although it was a hefty Â£75, it was well worth it. I'd recommend it to anyone!!
