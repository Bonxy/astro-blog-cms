Today was the day that i jumped from the Transport Bridge in middlesbrough and it was **fantastic.**

The feeling of just free falling towards the water at whatever speed was magnificent. Then when the bungee kicks in and you are bounced back into the air is quality. You bounce quite high when you come back up after the initial jump almost that you think your going to hit the bridge again.

You then plunge back down and then the bungee kicks in for a second time and thats pretty much it. It does only last about 10 seconds in total and then you feel yourself getting lowered back down to the awaiting boat below.

I cant really say much more as it was that amazing i cant put it into words. Although it was a hefty Â£75 it was well worth it. Id recommend it to anyone!!
