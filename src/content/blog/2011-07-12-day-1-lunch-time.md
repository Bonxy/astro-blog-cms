After doing a little workout last night I've and waking up this morning feeling a lot better than normal I've decided I'm really going to go for it hard. 

Really going to try and change my diet and do this properly. 

Todays items have included; 

**Breakfast**
- 2 Poached eggs on brown toast
- 1 Apple

**Lunch**
- Tune and Beans
- Apple & Orange

**Dinner**
- Spaghetti
- Yoghurt

That's all I've had. Not to bad for today i think. 

Going to do the same work out as last night aswell. Will update later.  Posted with WordPress for BlackBerry.
