Well, I don't know how I've done it but today (August 8th) marks my 1st anniversary with [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com).

I've never been one for long term relationships. The longest I had before this was back in school so this is quite a triumph. It only seemed a few years ago where I didn't want a girlfriend. 

"Party with the lads" used to be the most common thing I'd say and "I'm still far to young to be getting tied down". But then, when you least expect it..

It was a fancy dress party on June, 17th 2011. A girl from school who was at York university invited *the lads* out for a big piss up around York. 

We where each assigned a character to dress up as, I got **Chucky Finster**.

This is Chucky.

What a legend he is!

So, we go to the pub, all the lads dressed as there set characters: Batman, robyn, buzz, woody, tommy and chucky. There may have been the odd power ranger there to. 

We turn up at the pub and get the party started whilst waiting for the girls to come. 

[@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com) walked around the corner, blonde pigtails, purple dress, orange t-shirt! **Angelica**. Couldn't of been anyone else. It fitted to perfect. 

Considering we had never seen each other before, we hit it off straight away and she fell for me instantly. *I played it cool of course!*.

Our first date seeing *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2* (which she did actually cry at) to weekends away in london and birthdays up in alnwick. 

We have had a lots of fun together and I can only hope the fun keeps carrying on.  

Anyways, see you next year! :)
