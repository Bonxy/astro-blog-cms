A while ago when driving back from [#FCS](https://twitter.com/#!/search/french%20car%20show) in 2009 me and [@Cadab](http://imjam.es) stopped off at **OK Diner** on the A1 (Northbound) near *Grantham*. When there we found out that if you visited every OK Diner in the UK (We say every, there is only **8** in the **UK**) you get unlimited** free drinks** for life or something like that.

[![OK_Diner](https://blog.bonxy.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/OK_Diner-150x150.jpg)](http://bonxy.info/p/7990/ok_diner)The idea was born and we said that we would visit every single one just to complete the challenge.

We have visited 1 or 2 of them before but you have to visit each one and save the receipt from each one and then send it to the *OK Diner HQ* so we are going to have to start this again and save the receipts.

Heres a list of the restraunts and there completion status!
