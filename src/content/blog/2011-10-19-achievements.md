I had the idea of bringing achievements with the new bonxy system. 

I want to design it so if users do certain things or find certain things they can unlock certain achievements. Whether it be finding a dead end (404 page) or updating there profile information we can grant them a different achievement.

We can use this to go as far as we want. Whether it be sending an SMS from Bonxy SMS or checking in with a new app that i have in mind, they can be used all over the network. There just a little something thats for fun.

We could also offer points for certain achievements or different user functions. Like i said, it can be used for lots of different things and a user can keep track on all there achievements on a nice page.
