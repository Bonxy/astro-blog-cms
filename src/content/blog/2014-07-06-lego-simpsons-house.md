So as soon as i heard the news that Lego where going to release a Simpsons House model i knew i would have to buy it.

The build took me about 8 hours in total over 4 days. There was so much detail in every room. I was surprised at how well it resembled the one that i had seen on TV pretty much all my life.

The set wasnt just the house, it was a lot more. There was plenty of other accessories that you see on the program as well. The car, mailbox, BBQ, skate ramp, sun loungers and many more.
