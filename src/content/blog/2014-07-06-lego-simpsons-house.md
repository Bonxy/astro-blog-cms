So as soon as I heard the news that Lego where going to release a Simpsons House model, I knew I would have to buy it.

The build took me about 8 hours in total over 4 days. There was so much detail in every room. I was surprised at how well it resembled the one that I had seen on TV pretty much all my life.

The set wasn't just the house; it was a lot more. There were plenty of other accessories that you see on the program as well. The car, mailbox, BBQ, skate ramp, sun loungers and many more.
