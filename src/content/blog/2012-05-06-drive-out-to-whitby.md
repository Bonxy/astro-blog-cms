So a few weeks ago i organised a drive out for some old school members of a car forum i use called [ClioSport](http://cliosport.net/forum). I've owned a cliosport for the last 2 and a bit years and love the little car. I like going out for little drives either on my own or with some friends and getting a few pictures in some good spots. 

Anyways, back to the drive out. I thought a run out to [Whitby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitby) to go for some fish and chips, snap some photos and a general mooch about.
