Yesterday i received my notice of transfer from the very near finished #Hindhead Tunnel.

The tunnel opens today (27.07.2011) and on site there are TV crews and press reporters everywhere. Its a really good atmosphere down here. After 7 years of planning, designing, building, testing, commisioning and functioning of the tunnel its going to have its 1st ever public car go through. 

Then tunnel is scheduled to open at **10.30 AM**.

Enough of the tunnel. Forget the ridiculous drives down to london and beyond as im moving back home. Not as close as i would have liked to have been but it is closer.

So 1 hour and 30 minutes down the road, or few roads, is grimsby. Im going on a site called Conoco which is part of LOR (Lyndsey Oil Refinary). Its situated in grimsby, hull and is right on the coast i think ?

I dont know how long i will be going there for at the moment. My dads place is only 40 minutes up the road so i will be able to pay visits to him, and hopefully ill be able to finish work and go to the gym everynight and try and get alot fitter alot faster. 

I'll definatly be home every weekend and ill be able to set off alot later on a monday morning.

Ill report there at 8 AM monday morning. Ill blog then.
