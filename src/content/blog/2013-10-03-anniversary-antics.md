Well, since it was mine and [@RebekahEsme](http://rebekahesme.com) anniversary we thought it would be a good idea to book a holiday in at work and go out for the day and do something nice.

Neither of us could actually think of what to do, so we opted for going out for a picnic down by the reservoir.

The weather was spot on whilst we where there which was a bonus, and we also enjoyed feeding the many ducks most of our cheese and onion rings! **Good times!**
