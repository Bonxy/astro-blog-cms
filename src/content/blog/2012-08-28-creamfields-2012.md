The excitement had been slowly building up for weeks!

It was time for **CREAMFIELDS**.

Me and [@Cadab](http://imjam.es) where in the car and on our way at 3AM to make our way to Runcorn, Cheshire.

A nice easy drive down with some redbulls and music and we arrived at our destination at about 6.15. Perfect timing!! [![](https://blog.bonxy.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG-20120825-00333-300x225.jpg)](http://bonxy.info/2012/08/creamfields-2012/img-20120825-00333-jpg/)

Once we arrived we unloaded and got our holdalls on our backs. We had learnt from previous years that weight was an issue. Not only where you walking from your car to the site which was roughly a 20 minute plus walk, but then you had to stand and queue which could be for a few hours.
