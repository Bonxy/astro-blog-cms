description: So we took the dogs on a point-to-point from Chop Gate to Sheepwash
  Osmotherley...

So today me and [@Cadab](http://imjam.es) decided to go and do a point-to-point walk from [Chop Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chop_Gate) to [Sheepwash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheepwash,_North_Yorkshire) (Osmotherley).

This was one of the first point-to-point walks that we did across the Cleveland Way. We parked at [Clay Bank car park](https://goo.gl/maps/bex6Ci45Ky42) and got picked up over at [Sheepwash car park](https://goo.gl/maps/g9RAMwJX6EN2). It was a cold start to the day, but the weather opened up over the moors. There were numerous ascents and descents, but nothing too challenging.

We started our hike at 8:31 a,m and our total duration was 3hr 30mins.

Here is some data tracked from my Fitbit.

| Duration | Steps | Distance | Pace | Altitude | Heart Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3h 29m 01s | 20,087 | 9.0 Miles | 23'13" | 2,210 | 93 bpm |
