So today me and [@Cadab](http://imjam.es) decided to go and do a point to point walk from [Chop Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chop_Gate) to [Sheepwash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheepwash,_North_Yorkshire) (Osmotherley).

This was one of the first point to point walk that we did across the cleveland way. We parked at [Clay Bank car park](https://goo.gl/maps/bex6Ci45Ky42) and got picked up over at [Sheepwash car park](https://goo.gl/maps/g9RAMwJX6EN2). It was a cold start to the day, but the weather opened up over the moors. There was numerous ascents and descents but nothing to challenging.

We started our hike at 8:31 am and our total duration was 3hr 30mins.

Here is some data tracked from my Fitbit.
