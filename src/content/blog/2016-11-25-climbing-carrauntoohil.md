I'm not the best at stringing sentences together, so here is a little write-up of mine and @Cadab's climb of **_Carrauntoohil_**, County Kerry, Ireland.

An early start on a cold November Friday saw us heading to Leeds Bradford Airport to catch our cheap Ryanair flight to Dublin. We arrived in Dublin around 7.30 and had collected our hire car by 8.00.

Once we had picked up some supplies from a local Tesco (water, fruit, sandwiches and treats) and then a quick McDonald's breakfast, we embarked on our 4-hour, 207-mile (333 km) drive to Carrauntoohil.
