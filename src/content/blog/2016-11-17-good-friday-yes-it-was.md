First BBQ of the year? - Check!

So we had the idea of going camping over easter planned for a while, and it all fell into place this weekend.

So it was an early start on Friday, the 6th of April. We had agreed to meet at @Cadab's house and then shoot off from there! The campsite we had in mind was in Pickering, which would be about an hour's drive from his house. Unfortunately, you could not book at this campsite and when we rang on that morning, we were told that the weather had made some plots unavailable and the others were taking by people already. **bummer**.
